### Assignment 2

1. Area of a disk with radius r is Pi r*r. What is the area of a disk with radius 5?
2. The temperature is 35C; convert this temperature into Fahrenheit.
ºF =ºC * 1.8000 + 32.00
3. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3 Pi r3. What is the volume of a sphere
with radius 5?
4. Suppose the cover price of a book is Rs. 24.95, but bookstores get a 40%
discount. Shipping costs Rs. 3 for the first 50 copies and 75 cents for each
additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
5. I run 2 km at an easy pace (8 min per km), then 3 km at Tempo (7 min per km)
and 2 km at easy pace again to reach home. What is the total running time?

### Assignment 3

1. Develop the function of interest. It consumes a deposit amount and produces the actual
amount of interest that the money earns in a year. The bank pays a flat 2% for deposits of up to
Rs. 20 000, a flat 4% per year for deposits of up to Rs. 200000, a flat 3.5% per year for deposits
of up to Rs. 2000000, and a flat 6.5% for deposits of more than Rs. 200000.
2. Write a program in PatternMatching, takes the integer input from the command line. Based
on the input, write a code using match to print Negative/Zero is input when input is less than or
equal to 0.Print Even number is given when input is even, and print Odd number is given when
input is odd.
3. Write a Scala program which defines a method named "toUpper" and it accepts a String as
input parameter that is then formatted to upper case as output. Define another method named
"toLower'' which accepts a String as input parameter and formats the input to lower case as
output. Define another method named "formatNames" which also has an input String called
"name". This method however has a parameter group which accepts a function with an input of
type String and also outputs a String. This particular function will be used to apply the given
format to the "name" input. You can use the test inputs for, say, "Benny", "Niroshan", "Saman"
“Kumara”, and make sure that the output is as shown below.
Output:
BENNY
NIroshan
saman
KumarA

### Assignment 4

1. Write a recursive function prime(n) that returns true for a prime number and false for the other? For example prime(5) should return true and prime(8) should return false.
2. Write a recursive function primeSeq(n) that prints all prime number which less than n? For example prime(10) should print 2,3,5, and 7 on the terminal.
3. Write a recursive function returns the addition of numbers from1 to n? For example sum(5) should print 15
4. Write a recursive function to determine even and odd numbers?
5. Write a recursive function to get the addition of all even numbers less than given n.
6. The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . .
Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. Write a recursive function print fist n Fibonacci numbers for given n.

### Assignment 5

1. The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of
substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of
places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B
would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently
used it to communicate with his generals.
a. Implement Encryption and Decryption functions of Caesar cipher.
b. Then implement a Cipher function which takes Encryption and Decryption
functions to process the data.

### Assignment 6

1. Implement a Data Structure for Rational Number and create a method neg to class
Rational that is used like this: x.neg // evaluates to -x
2. Create a method sub to subtract two rational numbers and find an answer x-y-z where
x=3/4, y=5/8, z=2/7.
3. Implement a Data Structure for Account and create a method transfer which transfers the
money from this account to a given account.
4.  A Bank is defined as a List of Accounts. So implement the following functions:
    * List of Accounts with negative balances
    * Calculate the sum of all account balances
    * Calculate the final balances of all accounts after apply the interest function as follows:
        * If balance is positive, deposit interest is .05 and if balance is negative, overdraft interest is
.1
